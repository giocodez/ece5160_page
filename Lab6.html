    <h4>Describe How You Handle Sending / Receiving Data Over Bluetooth</h4>
    <text>
      The code to send and receive data over bluetooth remained the same as in the prior lab. The only thing that
      changed was that the array used to store ToF information was instead used to store Yaw information which corresponded to my theta.
    </text>

    <h4>Code Snippets</h4>

    <text>As can be seen, since I repurposed my code. I now pass in the yaw data IMU_d as ToF into PID_control.
      Therefore, yaw data is saved into a pid_arr where ToF data was saved in Lab 5 and then the case GET_PID send it to
      the notification handler written on the python side which then can get the information.
      I repurposed my code in this scenario
      since it was unnecessary to rewrite the function entirely.
      However, in future labs if both are needed at once it should be fairly simple to 
      implement extra memory in the array to save either IMU data or ToF data depending on the case
      and therefore run both of them.

    <h3>Lab Tasks</h3>
    <h4>P/I/D Discussion / Input Signal</h4>
    
    <text>I ended up choosing to implement PI control over PID control since adding the 
      derivative term amplifies the impact of noise on the controller and PI on its own showed sufficient performance. I first set all values to 0
      except for KP which I started at .06 which was my value from the last lab and began debugging it. 
      
      I chose not to do basic digital integration similar to what we did in Lab 2 due to the following problems:
      Digital integration involves accumulatiing error over time causing a drift
      in yaw. Therefore, using this technique would result in worse performance of PID_control over time as drift accumulates.
      Therefore, for the the PID input signal I decided to use the digital motion processor (DMP) to minimize the yaw drift
      since using a complimentary filter similar to Lab 2 with just yaw measurements wouldn't work
      since there are no accelerometer yaw readings and other filters (such as Low Pass Filter) would still lead to drift over periods of time. 
      Therefore, I figured it would be easier to use the DMP which uses the data from the accelerometer, gyroscope,
      and magnetometer to accurately get yaw without drift.
      To implement the DMP, I took inspiration
      from the example shared in class and the example code the tutorial suggested we use.
      Code changes are shared below.

    </div>

  <text>As one can see, I added to the setup() to
    initialize the DMP, then I implemented get_Yaw() to
    output the yaw whenver it was there and output -404
    whenever there were issues thus filtering those measurements out.
    Some limitations on the sensor to be aware about it that using the DMP mode 
    I did sets the maximum rotational velocirty to 2000 dps. This is sufficient for 
    our applications since we won't be moving our robot at a faster velocity. One could change the DMP mode to configure that parameter.

  <h4>Derivative Term</h4>

  <text>So I implemented PI control as opposed to PID control so my derivative term was 0.
    However, had I decided to tune for KD in theory changing the setpoint could lead to spikes
    in the data called derivative kicks due to the sudden change in desired theta resulting in a high error.
    As a result, this would result in spikes of motion unless you apply a lowpass filter to eliminate
    any high variance in data.
  </text>

  <h4>Programming Implementation and Debugging</h4>

  <text>I could repeatedly receive new data via my notification handler 
    so long as I had space left in my arrays. Via debugging, I found my KP
    to be .7 and my KI to be .001. I found my loop speed to be 11 ms. 
    However, get_Yaw() also returned yaw values at only a marginal slower rate.
    Theoretically, it should be somewhat slower since it occasionally does return 
    invalid values that are filtered out but it was measured out to
    producing a new valid yaw roughly every 11 ms as well. The range was between [-180, 180].
    Some plots are shown below with various
    measurements as I was debugging:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Plot 1: Controller still not working as desired due to prior code using -1 as an error output 
        since last code used that. Therefore, when it reached 0 it would spaz far in the negative direction.
        Fixed by using -404 as my no value found output which was outside the range [-180, 180]
      </li>
      <li>    Plot 2: Controller is still having random irratic behavior. Issue
        came out to be because of extrapolation from prior lab not working 
        as intended with yaw values. Was edited and fixed.
    </li>
      <li>    Plot 3: Plot of motion as seen in the later video after KI
        implemented.
    </li>
      <li>    Plot 4: Some tweaks to values to allow for more variation in the 
        controllers motor input.
    </li>
      <li>    Plot 5: Plot of video with KI (windings implemented)
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h4>Setpoint Update</h4>

  <text>To update the setpoint I made a new case which could be called in python.
    I then created a global variable set_setpoint which would be entered into the PID_control function 
    as set_setpoint and the case would update the value in set_setpoint. Snippet of the case 
    is below along with plot of change from 0 to 30 using ble.send_command(CMD.SET_SETPOINT, 30)
    as well as it receiving taps and then moving back to the desired position.
    There is a video next to it corresponding to the chart / situation. This code updates
    it live since the ble.send_command allows for live communication over the bluetooth protocol
    and the set_setpoint which is used as input is a global variable being updated in the case
    via this command.

    You will need to update the setpoint in real time in order to adjust
    the navigation of the vehicle. However, theoretically, 
    if you were to make it fully autonomous you could write an
    algorithm which chooses the setpoint just on the arduino rather than
    waiting for a call over bluetooth.
    In addition, some ideas in terms of how to control the orientation while the robot is 
    driving forward or back is to incrementally update the motor outputs
    based on the initial orientation and final orientation resulting
    in a curved path. Instead of having motors running in opposite directions,
    one could just have one side be more powerful than the other.
    An example of this would be if the vehicle were running straight
    at 200, 200 (left & right wheel motor input respectively),
    if one wanted it to move to the left then one could with the 
    appropriate computed time decrement it over time to reach values 
    of 150, 200 or whatever value was reasonable.

  <h4>Wind Up Protection</h4>

  <text>Wind Up Protection is necessary in Lab 6 for the same reason
    it was necessary in Lab 5. If you allow PID_I to build up with error over time 
    it will make your controller less responsive. Wind Up Protection, prevents this issue.
    I just implemented it the same as in Lab 5 and the same value (250) worked. A video of it working 
    with windings and not without is under PI Controller Videos.
