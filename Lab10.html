    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <h4>Bayes Filtering Localization</h4>

    <text>The task at hand is localization.
      To do this we will be implementing Bayes Filter Localization which 
      creates discrete space and estimates the probability that the robot is in those 
      spaces based off of observations in space. I'll be detailing its implementation later 
      in this lab.

    <h3>Localization in Sim</h3>
    <h4>Compute Control</h4>

    <text>The first function which I had to implement for localization was compute_control. 
      This function took in the current pose and the previous pose and estimated the control 
      information based on the odometry motion model.

    <text>I modeled my function off of the above equations shared in lab.
      Their implementation for the compute_control function is shared below.

    <h4>Odom Motion Model</h4>

    <text>Next I had to implement the odom_motion_model function.
      This function took in the current pose, previous pose, and the control data,
      and returns the probability of the new pose given the prior pose and control.
      For this function, I used the following information in the lab docs to model my function:

    <text>My implementation can be seen as follows:</text>

    </div>

    <h4>Prediction Step</h4>

    <text>Next, I had to implement the prediction step.
      To do this, I got the computed control from the compute control function and then
      using all the current poses and previous poses I computed the probability of the 
      odomotry motion model given those poses and the control. Then I updated the beliefs
      and normalized them at the end of the function. This was done to update the 
      probabilities in loc.bel_bar based on the previous time step and motion model.
      The implementation can be seen below.

      <img src="imgs\lab10_imgs\lab10_5.png" width="500" height="100">
    </div>

    <text>I originally had some trouble with the implementation of this. I had originally 
      accidently set both the cur_pos and prev_pos to the same values
      and this caused the updates of the bayes grid on the map to not
      be visualized. However, I soon discovered my error and correctly
      separated the two poses.
    </text>

    <h4>Sensor Model</h4>

    <text>The next function I needed to implement was the sensor model.
      This function took in all the observations and estimated the probabilities of each 
      sensor measurement given the robot pose. The below equation is used to find the 
      likelihood of the 18 measurements given a state.

      <img src="imgs\lab10_imgs\lab10_6.png" width="500" height="100">
    </div>

    <text>As one can see in my implementation below, the sensor_model function 
      returns probs which is an array of size loc.OBS_PER_CELLS per the returns 
      statement. For each i it checks the true observation versus the expected observation 
      along with the associated sigma to determine its probability before adding the 
      probability to the final output array.

    </div>

    <h4>Update Step</h4>

    <text>The last function that needs to be implemented is the update_step function.
      This function updates the probabilities in loc.bel based on loc.bel_bar and the sensor model.
      The function gets the current state and retrieves the sensor model and updates the belief.
      It then is normalized to provide an estimation of the robot's position.

    <h4>The Runs</h4>

    <text>Here I share videos of both of my runs. Green is the ground truth, blue is the belief, and red is the odometry.
      The distribution is mapped as a grid. Generally, the belief is pretty accurate and follows the ground truth roughly accurately.
      The odometry however, is a lot less accurate. This makes sense since the errors will compound with time until the estimation 
      is worthless. While the belief was pretty good, the bayes map generally followed it accurately and 
      displayed the general region of the true pose accurately. However, it wasn't always precise 
      on the exact location of the robot. I found that it was most accurate at the beginning and end of the trajectory
      but when it was closest to the wall the accurate diminished slightly. This could be because there are a lot of similar
      states that could be captured with the same distance to the nearest walls while when in the center of the map the 
      states are more unique in their expected measurements.
