    <h3>Collaboration Statement</h3>

    <text>Here is where I'll be detailing any collaboration that occured throughout this course</text>

    <h4>Collaborations</h4>

    <text>Aiden Derocher often sits with me in lab and we will discuss concepts as to potential approaches to problems.
        Specifically, Aiden has mostly given advice in regards to the hardware side of things such as soldering etc.
        since I come from a CS background so most of my questions are in regards to this aspect of the class.
        On Lab 5 specifically we worked together to implement and test the wind-up implementation.

    <text>I use AI tools primarily for documentation.
        For instance, instead of looking up "for loop arduino" on a site like W3Schools like I used to
        I will ask it in ChatGPT. The only other cases I will use it, is largely to clarify terminology such as
        in Lab 3, I asked it to clarify the meaning of "ranging time"

        Inspiration from prior course websites are detailed below:
    </text>

    <ul>
        <li>Lab 3 - Kaiyuan Xu 2024, gave inspiration as to how to wire the XSHUT pin to be able to address both ToF sensors.</li>
        <li>Lab 4 - Mengting Li 2024, gave inspiration as to how to do the wirings to the motor drivers from the motors, microcontroller, and battery.</li>
        <li>Lab 6 - Stephen Wagner, 2024, gave inspiration as to how to do the DMP and also to tape my car</li>
        <li>Lab 7 - Stephen Wagner, 2024, gave inspiration as to how to do the simulation</li>
        <li>Lab 7 - Mikayla Lahr, 2024, gave inspiration as to how to implement it on the car</li>
        <li>Lab 8 - Stephen Wagner, 2024, just borrowed the line to better handle DMP</li>
      </ul>

      Other code that inspired me:
    </text>

    <ul>
      <li>Lab 5 based PID_control function off of the python implementation in this notebook by Prof. Kirstin Petersen https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_WmZmfXWT6ty5xfPfsq36FhAmGa7oNtm?usp=sharing#scrollTo=3ITDgej_Sxhu</li>
      <li>Lab 6, DMP code was based off of DMP code in example shared in class and Stephen Wagner's documentation</li>
    </ul>
