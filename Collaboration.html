    <h4>Collaborations</h4>

    <text>Aiden Derocher often sits with me in lab and we will discuss concepts as to potential approaches to problems.
        Specifically, Aiden has mostly given advice in regards to the hardware side of things such as soldering etc.
        since I come from a CS background so most of my questions are in regards to this aspect of the class.

    <text>I use AI tools primarily for documentation.

    <ul>
        <li>Lab 3 - Kaiyuan Xu 2024, gave inspiration as to how to wire the XSHUT pin to be able to address both ToF sensors.</li>
        <li>Lab 4 - Mengting Li 2024, gave inspiration as to how to do the wirings to the motor drivers from the motors, microcontroller, and battery.</li>
      </ul>
