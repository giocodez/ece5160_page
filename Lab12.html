    <h2>Lab 12</h2>

    <h3>Strategy</h3>
    <h4>Localization</h4>

    <text>
      In order to maintain a more accurate robot, I decided that using 
      localization was paramount to being successful in this lab.
      In lab 11, I had a ton of issues with getting localization working 
      because of a windows specific error that didn't occur when I borrowed 
      my friend's Mac. Unfortunately, I didn't have access to my friend's 
      Mac for this lab so I had to resolve that issue. Some other 
      people who came across the same bug determined that it was as a 
      result of conda environment configurations and opted to completely
      remove conda from their system. Unfortunately, that wasn't an 
      option for me since I regularly use conda to handle environments
      for several projects I worked on. Instead, I just decided to restart
      and create a new system environment from scratch and make sure 
      all the pointers in the environment were proper and pointing 
      within the environment as intended and not referencing
      any outside files. After going through 
      all that, I was fortunate to eventually get it to work on my
      system, despite not having done anything significantly different 
      than my initial setup. I named this new environment FastRobots_ble_win
      to differentiate it from the original environment I had and my
      mac environment.

      With all that out of the way, I then tested out localization on 
      the computer just to make sure my robot was working properly.
      Results of my test run can be seen below.

    <h4>Path Planning</h4>

    <text>Given my localization was working fine on my 
      Windows computer that meant that I wanted to use that to
      plan my route to the next waypoint. As a result, I implemented 
      the following two functions that would take in the belief and 
      the next desired waypoint. The first function:
      determine_desired_orientation would output a value that would 
      be the amount the vehicle would want to rotate to move.
      The second function: determine_desired_distance would 
      output the amount the vehicle would need to travel to reach its waypoint.
      In the below screen, one can see a test localization and belief,
      and it being input into both of these functions and the output orientation 
      and distances in degrees and meters seen as 21.8 degrees and 1.64 meters.

    </div>

    <text>
      After getting these values I then repurposed my set_setpoint
      function to take in two floats. The first float corresponded with 
      whether I wanted to rotate or move forward and the second float 
      corresponded with the values I wanted to pass to the linear
      or rotary function. So for instance, if I wanted to use 
      orientation PID control, I could pass 1|45 to rotate 45 degrees.
      This case is shared below.

    <h4>Motion Control</h4>

    <text>
      After these flags are set, in the main loop it executes the following:
      First, it checks that the flags are true and sets terminate to false,
      it will then on its first run go into the initialize_f block of
      the respective linear or rotary section. initialize_f was set to 
      true in the case and it is set back to false after one run 
      through this block. This section is used to set variables back to 
      their initial condition, to get the current status of the robot,
      and then to determine the desired conditions. For instance,
      in the rotary case, it will keep running until a value yaw 
      value is returned and then the desired yaw is computed by taking 
      that value - the desired change and it will run the PID2 function 
      repeatedly until it returns true. In terms of the linear,
      multiple different tactics were implemented. Motion1() just being one 
      of them. Motion1() takes in a desired time to move at a set speed 
      and it will repeat it until roughly in the range of the desired 
      target. However, a linear PID controller was also implemented there 
      although that faced some difficulties at certain points to get 
      precise measurements. All the functions that are set to = terminate 
      are used to determine and then send control to the car and are 
      used to return true if reaching the desired condition, and false it changes 
      are necessary.

      When terminate is finally set, all the flags are set back to their 
      original condition to permit recalling it.

      For details on the Linear PID controller reference Lab5 and for details on the 
      Orientation Controller reference Lab6. The Motion1 implementation, just takes in 
      a time to move the vehicle forward and checks that its within range.

    <h4>Final Decisions In Terms of Control Functionality</h4>

    <text>
      I had a ton of issues with getting my orientation control to work perfectly.
      I switched out IMUs, I made sure the expected values were printing out as expected,
      I tried changing settings for the DMP but I was not able to get consistent results 
      for my orientation control. For some reason I couldn't get my DMP to output the values 
      that were necessary to reflect the real world circumstances. After talking with many TAs 
      and none of them able to pinpoint the issue, I decided to repurpose how my localization 
      functioned since that was working perfectly. Basically, my localization 
      moves 20 degrees at a time clockwise and is pretty accurate. Therefore,
      what I implemented is the following changes to my rotary_flag section:
    </text>

    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="imgs\lab12_imgs\lab12_5.png" width="500" height="100">
    </div>

    <text>
      Basically, what this does is it uses the localization PID control but 
      only asks it to rotate 20 degrees at a time before moving to the next step.
      Once it has done "enough" 20 degree turns to reach the desired_value
      then it will set terminate to true. These changes meant since my 
      car would only turn clockwise, I had to 
      change my output from determine_desired_orientation to be between 
      [0, 360] as opposed to [-180, 180]. This was fairly trivial
      to do as I just added 
      360 whenever the value was negative for my input.
      As a result, to turn -45 degrees, I had to actually turn 315 degrees.
      While this was inefficient, it was necessary for my car to be 
      consistently precise and work with my IMU outputs.
    </text>

    <h4>Steps for Best Run Functionality</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Localize at point</li>
      <li>Use pose to get desired orientation</li>
      <li>Use that to pass through to rotary_flag and turn it 
        the appropriate amount
      </li>
      <li>Use precomputed results, to determine expected ToF 
        measurements for both sensors and continue calling linear_flag
        until roughly in the desired range for one of them. Chose which 
        ToF to use to determine distance based on closeness to wall 
        as the closer one to a wall would be have more accurate readings.
        This means as one moves away from the initial point it would use 
        the back ToF sensor since it would have more accurate readings.
      </li>
      <li>Reach next waypoint and repeat</li>
    </ul>

    <text>Some exceptions to the above order was 
      not localizing at the final point and at the 
      6th waypoint. In addition, the values passed 
      to the linear_flag function scaled and were 
      generally larger for waypoints that were further 
      apart until within a certain closeness of the point.
      This means the last few waypoint motions had higher 
      initial inputs.

    <text>While I didn't end up screen recording the whole time,
      I took screenshots of the localizations and recorded the output 
      data in regards to the belief and probability. I share it below.

      This is a rough map of a comparison of the localizations to the desired path 
    to the estimated ground truth by watching the video. Generally the localizations 
    are pretty close and the route is roughly followed. Some points were reached but then 
    when rotating for the localization it came off the waypoint etc. This is because 
    I was having battery issues so I bumped up the PWM signal to make it move faster 
    but it wasn't fully tuned for that situation. Overall, the route is followed 
    generally pretty well.

    <h4>Room for Improvement</h4>

    <text>First of all, with more time I would have liked 
      to be able to figure out how to fix the incorrect sensor 
      readings I was getting to be able to more accurately 
      turn the robot and move it. Instead I ended up implementing
      much more rudimentary controls just to get it to work 
      as intended consistently even though it was much slower
      and not as clean or efficient as I would've liked.
      Furthermore, the workflow wasn't fully 
      automated. I had to copy the belief state output by my 
      localization to run it through the functions shared 
      and then after that I had to pass those values to my 
      car over bluetooth. So while this wasn't fully automated 
      it could easily be implemented. With more time 
      complete automation of this workflow 
      would be the next goal.
